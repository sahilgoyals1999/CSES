=>
Sometimes the program should read a whole input line, possibly containing spaces.
	string s;
	getline(cin, s);

=>
If the amount of data is unknown, the following loop is useful:
	while (cin >> x) {
		// code
	}
This loop reads elements from the input one after another, until there is no more data available in the input.
